## Test several approaches for images retrieval:
	* Feature Extraction from Pretrained CNN
	* Pretrained CNN finetuning
	* Siamese network from scratch
	* Siamese network with pretrained network

# TrainClassif
	Finetune a CNN for classification over few examples
	Finetune only the classifier or the entire network

# TrainSiamese
	Train a siamese network with pairs selection for image retrieval
